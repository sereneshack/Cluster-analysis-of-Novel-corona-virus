# Cluster-analysis-of-Novel-corona-virus

On 31 st December 2019 in China, a disease capable of spreading at a very high rate, identified as
Corona virus disease (COVID-19), was reported by the Municipal Health Commission, Wuhan.
Further, on 23 January 2020, Wuhan was locked down on the basis of the reports that it is
spreading due to community transmission in the cities. The COVID-19 has been spread to the
most of the parts of the world and is spreading at a very fast rate which is very difficult to control.
Till date, almost the whole world is affected with COVID-19 and is suffering a lot economically.
Till now , there is no specific treatment or vaccine or drug for the disease caused by the COVID-
19. The outbreak of COVID-19 is forcing many countries to take harsh steps and policies for
improving medical facilities such as ventilators, testing kits, masks, sanitizers etc. for protection of
people. It has resulted more than 10 lakhs deaths of people of different age groups. A highly
effective care should be taken of the patients suffering from COVID-19 should be taken. The
COVID-19 pandemic was declared as a global health emergency by the World Health
Organization(WHO) and it encouraged the nation to start improving their health policies and
facilites and start preparing for the health emergencies that the nation would be facing due to
COVID-19.
Data Science and related technologies plays a very important role in fighting against any
pandemic like 2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), COVID-19
to help governments and health managements to figure out the best preparation they can do to
make the world safe from the widespread of COVID-19. Data mining, machine learning and
several other technologies can be used to analyze data quickly and effectively to track and control
the spread of COVID-19 around the world.
The research commuinty is putting in lots of efforts to explore the medical, and sociological impact
of the COVID-19 pandemic so that immediate actions can be taken and the world is made free from
COVID-19 as soon as possible. The present study presents a novel analysis which results to
clustering countries with respect to active cases and the number of deaths. The cluster analysis
presented in the project would be highly beneficial to the managers of the health sectors, finance
experts and sociologists to take an immediate action for the highly affected areas and make them
safe from the spread of COVID-19.

In this study, we used clustering analysis to classify countries on the basis of dead and recovered
cases. Genetic, PSO, Harris Hawk and Grey-wolf optimization clustering was used to determine
the severity of countries in context to state of corona cases. The cluster analysis grouped into 20
clusters depending on the state of severity in various states. The severe country cluster needs more
medical facilities (ventilators, testing kits, masks etc), treatment etc to reduce number of deceased
persons. The clusters we have obtained are based on where the covid condition is more worse.
